###Workshops
___

#### Introduction to Arduino

**Overview**
This workshop is for anyone that has an interest in learning about programming and electronics, but has no experience with either. We will cover the basics of coding for the Arduino as well as the basics for working with simple circuits.

The goal of this workshop is to get participants comfortable with working with the Ardunio programming environment and uploading their own code to the Arduino board.

We will show the basics of input and output (I/O) on microcontrollers and make a bear bones simmple example of implementing both into one program.

Participants will learn how to turn an LED on and off with code alone, and then how it use a pushbutton switch to tell the Arduino when you want the LED to be on or off.
